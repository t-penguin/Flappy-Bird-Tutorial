## Assignment Instructions

## Changes Made
- Followed steps through the whole video, not just 1-3
- Used serialized private fields instead of public to ensure good encapsulation practices
- Used Unity's new input system instead of the legacy one
- Used Unity's new TextMeshPro instead of the legacy text (and related UI elements)
- Used C# events to decouple objects
- Made everything stop moving when the game ends
- Added a ground to prevent the player going off screen through the bottom
- Added an initial barrier over the top of the first pipe to prevent the player from flying over the pipes while still letting them fly up off screen
